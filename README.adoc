My personal (opinionated) asciidoc styleguide

== Headings

Always use the `=` sign for headers, never use underlining.

Good:

----
= Title
foo

== Level 1
bar

== Level 2
baz
----

Bad:

----
Level 1
-------
bar

Level 2
~~~~~~~
baz
----

== Line Breaks

Begin a new line for each sentence.
Don't break the line, even if your sentence is very long.
If your sentence is really long, think about rephrasing it into shorter sentences.
If you wish to hear more reasoning for this rule, please refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6RXRi5pBXg[this] awesome talk by @mojavelinux
